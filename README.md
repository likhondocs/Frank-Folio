# Secure Rewards System - Frank-Folio

Welcome to **Secure Rewards System**, a modern demonstration of a fully functional rewards web application that educates users on phishing techniques and how scammers could misuse similar systems to trick users. This project is designed to raise awareness about potential online scams while also showcasing modern web development best practices.

## Key Features

## Project Overview

The **Secure Rewards System** is a mock rewards platform created for educational purposes. It demonstrates how phishing scams work while educating users on the importance of verifying links and offers found online. It mimics how real-world scams trick users, but the ultimate goal is to show how to recognize and avoid falling victim to these scams.

The system uses interactive tasks like:
- Joining a Telegram channel
- Reacting to posts
- Subscribing to a YouTube channel

Each of these tasks is automated to simulate what a real phishing scam could try to get users to do.

## Installation

You can deploy the **Secure Rewards System** locally or host it using GitHub Pages or Vercel. Follow the steps below to install and run it:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/likhondocs/Frank-Folio.git```

Running Locally (with PHP)

If running the project locally with PHP installed, simply navigate to the project directory and run:

php -S localhost:8000

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Using Vercel

For Vercel hosting:

	1.	Create a Vercel account and install the Vercel CLI.
	2.	Navigate to the project directory.
	3.	Deploy the project:

vercel deploy

Usage

Once installed and running, users can navigate through the web application and perform tasks such as:

	1.	Claiming the $50 reward (simulated) via interactive buttons.
	2.	Joining Telegram groups automatically.
	3.	Reacting to posts and subscribing to YouTube channels.

This simulates the behavior that could be seen in phishing scams, but itâ€™s designed to help users recognize malicious behavior and avoid such tricks in the future.
